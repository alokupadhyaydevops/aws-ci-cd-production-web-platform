# Releases

This folder represents versioned application releases.

Each deployment generates a new version:
- v1/
- v2/
- v3/
- ...

The live system always points to the version defined as `current`.

This structure allows:
- Safe deployments  
- Easy rollback  
- Traceable versions  
- Production-style release management
