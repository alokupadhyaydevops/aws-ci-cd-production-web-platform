# AWS CI/CD Production Web Platform

This project demonstrates how to design, build, and operate a production-style web platform on AWS using real-world cloud and DevOps practices such as load balancing, auto scaling, CI/CD automation, secure IAM integration, and deployment debugging.

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of a real-world cloud deployment architecture.

It simulates how modern engineering teams deploy applications using:

- Automated CI/CD pipelines  
- Scalable cloud infrastructure  
- Secure access between systems  
- Zero manual deployment on servers  
- Real debugging of production-like issues  

The focus of this project is not just to "make it work", but to understand:
- Why each component is used  
- How components interact  
- What breaks in real systems  
- How engineers debug and fix those issues
